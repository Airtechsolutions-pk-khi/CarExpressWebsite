                    <p><strong>1.</strong> We at Samia Crafts reserve the right to Substitute the product with a suitable product if the ordered product is not available. Please understand that substitutions are necessary to ensure timely delivery of each order and we may or may not contact you before substituting the product. You are also requested to note that all the product images are Studio Images and the actual product delivered may have completely/ Partially different look and feel.

                    <p>The customer refund procedure might take 2-7 working days to process on the Debit /Credit Cards bank payment gateway. The customer has to follow on with the bank in case of any delay in crediting back the customer’s account with the amount previously paid by the customer. We will send an email to the customer that contains a printout of the refund advice printed from Debit / Credit Cards bank payment gateway as reference in case the customer wants to revise the bank with.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.</strong> No refund request or complaints on grounds that <strong>"I asked this order to be delivered at X time and you didn't"</strong> will be entertained. Please note that we only guarantee delivery on a specified date. We in no way guarantee delivery within a specified time frame, but we will try our best to deliver it always on the time frame requested, but in case the order was delivered on a later time No refunds requested or complains will be entertained.</p>

                    <h3>Shipment and Delivery Policies</h3>

                    <p><strong>Product delivery:</strong> During any product delivery made by Samia Crafts, if the client is not available in the address specified in the system, the product ordered by the client shall not deliver to anywhere else. Within the framework of such a case, the member must accept all legal responsibilities arising from ordering a product to an address where he/she does not exist.</p>
                    <p>We may not be able to provide you with the receivers name or POD if the order is for a "Wedding", "Funeral", "Hotels", "Hostels" or "Hospital". No refund requests or non-delivery complains will be entertained on such grounds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Please understand that we may not be permitted to carry the products directly to a room in a "hospital", "hostels" or "hotel" and hence we may we forced to leave them with the reception. Quite often the reception will not sign a delivery confirmation note and hence we may not be able to provide a POD for such deliveries. For flower deliveries made to a Funeral, it does not look nice to trouble the already grieved relative with the Signing process. Hence we may not be able to provide a POD for such deliveries. For flower or gift deliveries made to a wedding hall we may not be able to provide you with a POD if the Bride or Groom or their relative does not cooperate and refuse to sign the POD indicating they are busy or they do not have time.</p>
